# ACVTool

`acvtool.py` instruments Android apk and produces its code coverage without original source code. Code coverage is based on Smali representation of the bytecode.

## Prerequisites
1. `Windows`/`OSX`/`Ubuntu`.
3. `Java` version `1.8`.
2. `Android SDK`.
4. `Python` version  `2.7`.

## Installation
1. Run the `pip` command to install dependencies:

    ```shell
    $ cd acvtool
    $ pip install -e .
    $ acv -h
    ```

When successfully installed, you will be able to execute `acv -h`. This command will create the working directory "~/acvtool" and the configuration file "~/acvtool/config.json". 

2. Specify absolute paths to the Android tools at "~/acvtool/config.json" (%userprofile%\acvtool\config.json in Windows) for the following variables.
    * AAPT
    * ZIPALIGN
    * ADB
    * APKSIGNER

2.1. Windows configuration example

    ```json
    {
        "AAPT": "[%userprofile%]\\appdata\\local\\android\\sdk\\build-tools\\25.0.1\\aapt.exe",
        "ZIPALIGN": "[%userprofile%]\\appdata\\local\\android\\sdk\\build-tools\\25.0.1\\zipalign.exe",
        "ADB": "[%userprofile%]\\appdata\\local\\android\\sdk\\platform-tools\\adb.exe",
        "APKSIGNER": "[%userprofile%]\\appdata\\local\\android\\sdk\\build-tools\\24.0.3\\apksigner.bat",
    }
    ```
2.2. OSX, Linux configuration example

    ```json
    {
        "AAPT": "[$HOME]/Library/Android/sdk/build-tools/25.0.3/aapt",
        "ZIPALIGN": "[$HOME]/Library/Android/sdk/build-tools/25.0.3/zipalign",
        "ADB": "[$HOME]/Library/Android/sdk/platform-tools/adb",
        "APKSIGNER": "[$HOME]/Library/Android/sdk/build-tools/24.0.3/apksigner",
    }
    ```



### Workflow

Steps:
1. Instrument the original APK with ACVTool. [instrument <path>]
2. Install the instrumented APK in the Android emulator or device. [install <path>]
3. Initiate instrumentation process in the emulator. [start <package>]
4. Test the application. (just click the installed app)
5. Finish instrumention process in the emulator. [Press Ctrl+C]
6. Generate coverage report. [report <package> -p <pickle_path>]

Instrument an apk:

    ```shell
    $ acv instrument <path>
    ```

An APK file and \<package_name>.pickle file will be created.

Install/uninstall the app in emulator/device:

    ```shell
    $ acv install <path>
    $ acv uninstall <path>
    ```

Initiate instrumentation process of the APK:

    ```shell
    $ acv start <package.name>
    ```

Now the application must be tested manually or automatically. Acvtool itself does not provide the strategies for testing. Finish instrumentation process to generate coverage file by Ctrl+C.
Generate coverage report after tesing of apk:

    ```shell
    $ acv report <package.name> -p <path>
    ```

### Example

1. Instrument the original APK with ACVTool, and run the emulator:

    ```shell
    $ acv instrument test_apks/snake.apk
    ```

    ```shell
    $ emulator -avd [device-name] &
    ```

2. Install the instrumented APK in the Android emulator or device:

    ```shell
    $ acv install ~/acvtool/acvtool_working_dir/instr_snake.apk
    ```

3. Initiate instrumentation process in the emulator:

    ```shell
    $ acv start com.gnsdm.snake
    ```

4. Test the application. 

    Interact with the application a little bit.

5. Finish instrumention process in the emulator. 
    
    Press "Ctrl+c" in the console where the acvtool has been launched with "acv start".

6. Generate the coverage report. 

    ```shell
    $ acv report com.gnsdm.snake -p  ~/acvtool/acvtool_working_dir/metadata/com.gnsdm.snake.pickle
    ```

The coverage report will be located at "~/acvtool/acvtool_working_dir/report/com.gnsdm.snake/report"
